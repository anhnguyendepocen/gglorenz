# About `gglorenz`

The goal of `gglorenz` is to plot Lorenz Curves with the Blessing of `ggplot2`.

# Installation

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jjchern/gglorenz")

# To uninstall the package, use:
# remove.packages("gglorenz")
```

# Example

Suppose you have a vector with each element representing the amount the stuff a person produced, and you are interested in knowing how much stuff are produced by the top x% of the people, then the `gglorenz::stat_lorenz(desc = TRUE)` would make a graph for you.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gglorenz)

    ggplot(aes(TNW)) +
    stat_lorenz(desc = TRUE) +
    coord_fixed() +

    hrbrthemes::scale_x_percent() +
    hrbrthemes::scale_y_percent() +
    labs(x = "Cumulative Percentage of the Top 500 Billionaires",
         y = "Cumulative Percentage of Total Net Worth",

         caption = "Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/")
